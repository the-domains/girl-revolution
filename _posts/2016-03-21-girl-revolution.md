Girl Revolution

The notion of Girl Revolution came about as a key to spending quality time with families irrespective of busy lifestyles.

Part of that quality time is also about addressing transitions that happen in our life.

Transitions are an inner reorientation and a redefining of meaning that we make to integrate changes. We can choose to mark these changes with a conscious step that fosters a positive wellbeing.

When we mark transitional changes we grow a stronger sense of personal responsibility to all aspects of our lives. We also encourage a greater connection to our community through the bonding of ages and the sharing of who we are.

The Aim

The intention of the program is to encourage understanding, skills, attitudes and values necessary to lead healthy and fulfilling lives for the pre-adolescent girl and her family. Some of the ways this is addressed is through;

Develop an understanding about the transition from girl to young woman including the physical, emotional, social and intellectual changes of puberty and the process and management of menstruation.

Enhancing our girl's self-esteem, communication and decision making skills in relation to taking responsibility and taking care of themselves physically and emotionally.

Encourage feminine camaraderie as opposed to competition amongst their peers.

PROGRAMMES

Understanding Your Adolescent Girl:

Talk

"The structure of a female brain at puberty determines not only how they think but what they value and how they communicate."  Louann Brizendine -- TheFemale Brain.

This talk delivers a greater understanding of the changes that occur in the female brain during puberty. We look at how that impacts on a physical, emotional and social level. The talk offers practical tools for you to support the adolescent girl through this transition time.

Girl Revolution Workshop

A one-day workshop designed for the prepubescent girl (9-12). The workshop explores the changes that happen during puberty in a fun, non-threatening way that also educates the young girl on healthy methods to guide them through adolescence.
